# Headcrab Junkyard

Welcome to our junkyard!

This is our page on GitHub, which is used for mirroring some of the repos from our main page on (GitLab)[https://gitlab.com/headcrab-junkyard] so if you wanna open an issue for some of the repos you better do that there

We are currently working on the GoldSrc engine reimplementation (here)[https://github.com/headcrab-junkyard/OGS] and its upgraded version (something similar to Source Engine but following its own "evolution" path) (here)[https://github.com/headcrab-junkyard/ApertureSrc]

We also have our own reimplementation projects for both the (engine SDK)[https://github.com/headcrab-junkyard/ogs-sdk] and the (game code)[https://github.com/headcrab-junkyard/openlambda], which are GPL-licensed and compatible with the engine reimplementations

There is also an attempt to reimplement the (VGUI2 library)[https://github.com/headcrab-junkyard/vgui2-reimp] and its (controls/widgets code)[https://github.com/headcrab-junkyard/revgui_controls] to make that functionality accessible to game/mod developers
